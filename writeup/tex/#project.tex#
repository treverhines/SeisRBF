\section*{Introduction}
  In recent years seismologists have become interested in numerically
  modeling seismic waveforms, where their goal is to use t



Imaging the interior
  of the Earth from seismic waves requires an accurate means of
  predicting how seismic waves would propagate through the Earth for
  any given realization of its elastic properties.  In the past decade
  there has been a great deal of interest in using numerical methods
  to calculate how seismic waves propagate through the earth.  Among
  the numerous methods are finite difference methods, finite element
  methods, spectral element methods, and method of circles.  In this
  paper I exlplore the potential for radial basis function.

  Radial basis functions have two appealing properties for a
  seismologist.  They allow for an arbitrary topology with any
  distribution of collocation points and any geometry. Although Global
  seismologists assume a disk or spherical domain, which could be
  handled with trigonemetric pseudospectral methods, seismology also
  can be on regional scales where complex domains resulting from
  topography or sedimentary basins could complicate things. it is also
  a remarkably easy method to understand.


Seismic 
Solve the problem
\begin{equation}\label{Problem}
  u_t = F(u),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{F}
  F(u) = \nu u_{xx} - uu_x,
\end{equation}
u is $2\pi$ periodic, $\nu=1/10$, and the initial condition are
\begin{equation}\label{IC}
  u(x,0) = 1 - \sin(x).
\end{equation}
Use the Fast Fourier Transform and an explicit time-marching method to
integrate from t=0 to t=2.  Present graphs illustrating
\begin{enumerate}
\item the evolution of the Fourier coefficients with time and
\item the evolution of u(x,t) with time.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Solution}

I solve eq. (\ref{Problem}) by first discretizing the time domain into
$M$ time steps as
\begin{equation}
  t_j = \frac{2j}{M}, \quad j=\{0,1,...,M-1\}
\end{equation} 
and then I find $u(x,t_{j+1})$ with an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme.
For each iteration, eq. (\ref{F}) is evaluated at $u(x,t_j)$ as
descibed in the following paragraph.  

I approximate $u(x,t_j)$ with a complex exponential series containing
$N$ terms:
\begin{equation}\label{series}
  u(x,t_j) \approx \sum_{k=-N/2}^{N/2-1}\alpha_{jk}e^{ikx}.
\end{equation}
The choice of exponential basis functions ensures that the $2\pi$
periodic condition is satisfied.  I define my $N$ collocation points
as
\begin{equation}
  x_n = \frac{2\pi n}{N}, \quad n = \{0,1,...,N-1\},
\end{equation}
and then find $\alpha_{jk}$ for the current time step by making use of the
discrete Fourier transform:
\begin{equation}\label{dft}
  \alpha_{jk} = \mathrm{DFT}[u(x_n,t_j)]_k =
  \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}u(x_n,t_j)e^{-ikx_n}, \quad
  k=\{-N/2,...,N/2-1\}.
\end{equation}  
I then evaluate eq. (\ref{F}) substituting $u$ with the series in
eq. (\ref{series}) and using the coefficients found from
eq. (\ref{dft}). For computational efficiency, the derivatives inside
eq. (\ref{F}) are evaluated in the Fourier domain. Namely, I use the
properties
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{DFT}[u_{x}(x_n,t_j)]_k = (ik)\mathrm{DFT}[u(x_n,t_j)]_k = (ik)\alpha_{jk}
\end{equation}   
and
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{DFT}[u_{xx}(x_n,t_j)]_k = (ik)^2\mathrm{DFT}[u(x_n,t_j)]_k = (ik)^2\alpha_{jk}
\end{equation}   
to evaluate eq. (\ref{F}) as
\begin{equation}
  F(u(x_n,t_j)) = \mathrm{IDFT}[\nu(ik)^2\alpha_{jk}]_n -
  u(x_n,t_j)\mathrm{IDFT}[(ik)\alpha_{jk}]_n,
\end{equation}   
where IDFT is the inverse discrete Laplace transform, which I define as
\begin{equation}\label{ift}
  u(x_n,t_j) = \mathrm{IDFT}[\alpha_{jk}]_n =
  \sum_{k=-N/2}^{N/2-1}\alpha_{jk}e^{ikx_n}, \quad
  n=\{0,1,...,N-1\}.
\end{equation}   
In total, evaluating eq. (\ref{F}) requires three Fourier transforms
and the computational cost for each time step is $O(N\log N)$ when
using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.  

The procedure described above is demonstrated in the below Python script.

\section*{Results}
The solution for $u(x,t)$ using $M=1000$ and $N=200$ is shown in
figure 1.  As time progresses, the initial sine wave moves in the
positive $x$ direction while also becoming steeper on the leeward
side.  The amplitude of the wave also decreases over time as $u(x,t)$
approaches its steady state value of 1.      

Figure 2 shows the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients,
$\alpha_{jk}$, over time.  The coefficients are spectrally accurate
throughout the time interval from 0 to 2.  However, the amplitude of
the high frequency coefficients increases over time and it is likely
that the solution for $u(x,t)$ would become unstable if I continued
time stepping much further past $t=2$.
